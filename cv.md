### Biography

Recently, I realized that one "business of life" cannot be limited, so I decided on global changes. For 8 years, I have studied my past direction from and to, so now I want to scale my successes in other areas. Ready for full immersion in processes, projects, and team. From me, involvement, dedication, control, development of myself and colleagues, and much more. I think that front-end development is the most suitable business for revealing my talents.
